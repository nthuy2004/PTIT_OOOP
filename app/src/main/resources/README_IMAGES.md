# Background Images

To use the LoginFrame with a background image, place your background image file named:
`Blue and White Modern Dental Medical Presentation.png`

in this directory (app/src/main/resources/).

The LoginFrame will automatically load this image as the background. If the image is not found, it will use a default background.
